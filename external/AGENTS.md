# AGENTS.md

## Scope

These instructions apply to `external/`.

This directory is a read-only reference workspace for external plugins that Xel's Combat AI integrates with through IPC, shared data, or reflected runtime behavior.

Root repository instructions apply only for how to use this subtree as reference material. Do not apply root C# style, formatting, validation, or refactor rules to external checkouts.

## Rules

- Do not edit, format, refactor, delete, or rename external plugin files.
- Do not stage or commit external plugin source, binaries, build outputs, repository metadata, or nested `.git` directories.
- Do not add external plugin code to project files, package manifests, release artifacts, or build scripts.
- Use these files only to inspect IPC contracts, payload shapes, public API behavior, reflected member names, and integration details.
- Prefer current external source evidence over memory when working with BossMod Reborn, Avarice, RotationSolver Reborn, or Dalamud integration behavior.
- When using external evidence in a change, summarize the contract that was verified rather than copying upstream code into this repository.
- If an integration requires an upstream code change, make that change in the upstream repository and then refresh the local checkout after the upstream branch includes it.

## Refreshing References

- `sources.json` is the source of truth for external repository URLs and tracked branches.
- Run `external/fetch-sources.sh` from anywhere in the repository to clone or refresh the ignored reference checkouts.
- Reference checkouts should track the latest remote branch heads, not pinned commits.
