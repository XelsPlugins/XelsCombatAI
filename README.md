# Xel's Combat AI

A Dalamud plugin that automatically manages your BossMod Reborn movement and positioning settings during combat so you don't have to think about them.

## Requirements

- [BossMod Reborn](https://github.com/FFXIV-CombatReborn/BossmodReborn)
- [Avarice](https://puni.sh/api/repository/veyn) (for positional management)
- [RotationSolver Reborn](https://github.com/FFXIV-CombatReborn/RotationSolverReborn) (optional, required for Manage True North and AoE pack positioning)

## What it does

While you are in combat, the plugin automatically:

- **Moves you to the correct positional** (rear/flank) based on your autorotation
- **Keeps you at the right distance** from your target based on your role
- **Switches to AoE distance** when there are multiple enemies nearby
- **Stays close to a tank** when your target doesn't have a boss module
- **Manages your Ley Lines** — returns to them when safe, uses Between the Lines and Retrace if available
- **Stays clear of forbidden zones** with a configurable buffer distance
- **Uses BossMod-checked gap closers** to re-engage after being knocked away or escape a dangerous spot (optional, off by default)
- **Optimizes AoE pack positioning** by using RSR's next GCD preview to let BossMod prefer locations that hit more enemies (experimental, optional, off by default)
- **Shows a decision overlay** with projected in-world markers for current movement decisions and candidates (optional, off by default)
- **Pauses automated movement** briefly when you move manually, including remapped movement or gamepad input reported by BossMod
- **Manages True North** usage and disables RSR's Auto True North to prevent conflicts (optional, requires RSR)

Out of combat, the plugin stops managing movement entirely and hands control back to you. Settings are automatically re-applied after death and resurrection.

## Installation

Add the following URL to Dalamud's custom plugin repositories:

```

```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/xcai` | Toggle the plugin on/off |
| `/xcai on` | Enable |
| `/xcai off` | Disable |
| `/xcai config` | Open settings |

## Configuration

Open the settings window with `/xcai config` or through the Dalamud plugin list. The window is split by intent so related options stay together.

### Main tab

**Main** — Toggle the plugin, movement management, manual movement pause, combat style, whether to follow the tank on trash pulls (targets with no boss module), and healer party coverage on boss fights.

### Positioning tab

**Positioning** — Manage positionals, True North, Ley Lines, the decision overlay, and experimental AoE pack positioning.

- *Manage positionals* — Moves you to the correct rear/flank position for your rotation.
- *Manage True North* — Uses True North automatically and disables RSR's Auto True North to prevent conflicts. Requires RSR.
- *Manage Ley Lines* — Helps BLM stay on Ley Lines and use Between the Lines / Retrace when available. Does not place Ley Lines.
- *Decision overlay* — Draws current decisions and candidates in the world overlay. Green is active, blue is a candidate, yellow is preview-only, red is rejected, gray is suppressed, and white is BossMod's current movement intent.
- *AoE Pack Positioning* — Uses RSR's upcoming GCD preview and a reflected BossMod hook to add an AoE hit-count goal to BossMod pathfinding. Supports common circle, cone, and line AoE shapes. Unsupported actions and reflection failures are ignored.

### Distance tab

**Manage range** — Master toggle for all distance management.

**Single target distance** — Set your preferred max distance per role (melee, physical ranged, healer, magic ranged). Disable to stop managing single-target distance.

**AoE target distance** — When multiple enemies are nearby the target, the plugin switches to these distances instead. The threshold controls how many enemies must be present to trigger AoE mode. You can also enable non-AST healers to use melee AoE distance so they stay in range of their ground targets.

**Forbidden zone** — Keeps you a set distance back from forbidden zones to avoid clipping into them.

### Gap Closers tab

**Re-engage gap closers** — Uses supported gap closers to return to melee range when BossMod reports the dash is safe. Disabled by default.

**Escape gap closers** — Uses supported movement abilities to help BossMod reach safety faster when the landing point is safe and moves toward BossMod's safe point. Disabled by default. BLM will not escape out of Ley Lines in Greed mode.

**Minimum distances** — Sets the minimum distance required before using optional gap closers for re-engage or safety. Each slider is disabled when its matching gap-closer option is off. Defaults to 8y.

### Chat & Reset tab

**Feedback** — Toggle whether enable/disable commands are echoed to chat.

Use **Copy debug state** to copy a full runtime, integration, and configuration snapshot for troubleshooting.

Use **Reset ranges** to restore all distance values to defaults, or **Reset all** to restore the full configuration.
